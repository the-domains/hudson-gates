# Welcome

Welcome to Hudson Gates. For nearly nine years we have been providing a range of consulting services in the Human Capital Management space. We've done implementations and upgrades of Learning Management Systems; we consulted around compliance processes and governance; we've helped organisations analyse their learning operations to find out how they could improve the way they manage learning; we've developed eLearning content; we've built lots of reports; and whole bunch of other things which over the years have helped our customers learner better, manage better and perform better.

But the time has come to shift gears and change direction a bit. From now on, we will have a much tighter focus:

* Helping organisations define their eLearning content strategy
* Building high quality content at a reasonable price

If you are interested in learning more about how HG can help with your eLearning content plans, contact us at curious@hudsongates.com.
